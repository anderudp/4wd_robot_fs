The aim of this project is the creation of a 4 wheel drive robot car that can follow a path and detect obstacles or edges. Along the way, I will create many example projects, found in the numbered subdirectories.
This repo contains the home directory of a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B, with the following pinout:

![RPi2 Pinout](rpi-pinout.png?raw=true "Raspberry Pi 2 Pinout")

The RPi was configured in CLI mode, Arduino programming was done with [arduino-cli](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/1.0/getting-started/).
